I'm struggling writing a method for R's `is.integer()` function.

First, I know that this is a primitive function:

`is.primitive(is.integer)`
`TRUE`

According to the help for the `methods` package:

"A number of the basic R functions are specially implemented as primitive functions . . . Most have implicit generics (see implicitGeneric), and become generic as soon as methods (including group methods) are defined on them. Others cannot be made generic."
