I am using the `v.extract` tool in **GRASSS** to select a part of a vector. When I do, the output has the same geographic extent as the input (note the lower `y` extent value is the same). Why is this happening and how can I "force" **GRASS** to recognize the new extent of the selected portion of the vector?

Here is the vector.  I'm accessing **GRASS** through **R** using the `rgrass` pacakge, but the outcome is the same when I do it natively in **GRASS**.

# `rgrass` implementation
```
library(rgrass)
library(terra)

vector <- vect('./madCoast4.gpkg') # vector from link above
raster <- rast(vector) # raster to provide to initGRASS()

# initiate GRASS
rgrass::initGRASS(
	gisBase = 'C:/Program Files/GRASS GIS 8.3',
	home = tempdir(),
	gisDbase = tempdir(),
	location = 'example',
	SG = raster
)

# export to GRASS and extract the northern feature
write_VECT(vector, vname = 'madCoast4')
rgrass::execGRASS('v.extract', input = 'madCoast4', output = 'selection', cats = '1')

# compare extents of original and extracted feature
rgrass::execGRASS('v.info', map = 'madCoast4')
rgrass::execGRASS('v.info', map = 'selection')

```
